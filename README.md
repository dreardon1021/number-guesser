###Number Guesser Project
####Cristina and Dan

This project is a basic number-guessing game where two challengers compete to guess a randomly generated number in the fewest guesses possible. The players can set a custom range, which will generate a new random number within that range. After each guess, players receive feedback on if their guessed number was too high or too low (or correct). When a player wins, a card appears in the right column telling them how many guesses it took to reach the correct answer. After a game is won, the game resets and players can continue. A card will be added for each win. Players can also close out of the card if they choose.
